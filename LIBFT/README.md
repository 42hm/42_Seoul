# :books: libft

The libft project is an individual project at 42Seoul that aims to recreate various standard library functions in C.

It provides a collection of essential utility functions that can be used in future projects.

## :mortar_board: What I Learned

Through the libft project, I gained knowledge and experience in the following areas:

- Implementing standard library functions from scratch to understand their inner workings
- Developing utility functions for common tasks, such as string manipulation and input validation
- Creating and managing data structures, such as linked lists, for efficient data organization
- Implementing algorithms for tasks like sorting and searching
- Understanding and applying memory management techniques, such as dynamic memory allocation and deallocation
- Developing error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected situations
- Writing modular and reusable code through proper organization and abstraction
- Utilizing standard library functions effectively to enhance functionality and efficiency
