# :scroll: get_next_line

The get_next_line project is an individual project at 42Seoul that aims to read a file or multiple files line by line.

The function provides a convenient way to read text from a file descriptor until a newline character is encountered.

## :mortar_board: What I Learned

Through the get_next_line project, I gained knowledge and experience in the following areas:

- File I/O operations in C, including opening, closing, and reading files
- Managing file descriptors and utilizing them to perform read operations
- Implementing buffering techniques for efficient reading and minimizing system calls
- Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation for efficient memory usage
- Handling edge cases, such as handling different newline formats and reaching end-of-file
- Developing error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected situations
- String manipulation techniques for extracting and processing line data
- Utilizing standard library functions and data structures to enhance functionality and efficiency
- Developing modular and reusable code through proper organization and abstraction
